ALGORITHMICS FOR DATA MINING

In the discipline of Data Mining, many technologies allow organizations to improve their processes on the basis of the analysis of existing data and the search for patterns in them. However, available success stories notwithstanding, is mandatory to acquire a consciousness of the limitations of these technologies: we will develop a study of the most usual algorithms and of their main parameters, so that the students become capable of identifying suitable tools for a given application. We will explain the theory and the practical usage of clusterers, associators, and classifiers so that the students acquire criteria to choose values for the many free parameters of each of these algorithms.
